# Sign-Language-Detection
README
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project aims to develop a Sign Language Detection System using computer vision and machine learning techniques. The system detects and recognizes hand gestures corresponding to different sign language symbols, enabling real-time communication between deaf or mute individuals and others.

By leveraging OpenCV, MediaPipe, and a deep learning model, this project interprets gestures and translates them into text or speech, making communication more accessible.

ðŸŽ¯ Features
Real-time hand gesture detection using webcam input.
Pre-trained or custom-trained deep learning models for sign recognition.
Support for multiple sign languages (e.g., ASL, ISL, BSL).
Interactive UI with live gesture tracking.
Text and Speech output for recognized gestures
